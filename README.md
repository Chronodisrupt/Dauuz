DAUUZ (DUZ)

Decentralized Participation Token

Tagline: Elpis — Man paves his own path



Overview

DAUUZ (DUZ) is a fixed-supply digital participation token designed to reward real human effort, contribution, and growth — not capital, speculation, or automation.

DAUUZ begins off-chain with a verifiable participation system and evolves on-chain over time, connecting contribution, community building, and long-term mental wellness to tangible digital value.

> No hype. No shortcuts. No secret minting.





1. Vision

Modern systems reward capital, bots, and attention extraction.
DAUUZ exists to reward presence, creativity, consistency, and contribution.

DAUUZ aims to:

Empower ordinary people to earn value through action

Build a contribution-first digital economy

Create a scarce, psychologically meaningful token

Connect long-term self-growth with economic participation


> “We reward effort before speculation.”

3. Prelaunch Participation System (MVP)

Before any blockchain integration, DAUUZ operates a participation-mining MVP.

Users earn DUZ by completing verifiable, human actions.

Example Tasks

Task	Reward	Limit

Referral	0.001 DUZ	Unlimited
Awareness / Social Post	0.00125 DUZ	Max 4/day
Survey Completion	0.005 DUZ	Once
Feedback 0.0014 DUZ weekly 
Wellness Routine 0.014
Idea Submission	1 DUZ	Reviewed



Principle:

> Hard-earned DUZ represents real contribution, not wasted computation.



All rewards are tracked transparently in the backend during prelaunch.




4. Zoi Integration (Future)

Zoi is a planned mental-wellness companion app that will integrate with DAUUZ.

Zoi focuses on:

Journaling & reflection

Emotional awareness

Daily consistency & self-growth

Mental health support beyond traditional therapy models


Zoi → DUZ Conversion

Zoi generates Zoi Points

Zoi Points convert to DUZ via controlled mint cycles

Mint cycles occur every 2–4 years, similar to Bitcoin halvings

Conversion draws from the locked Zoi Reserve


> You grow → You heal → You earn → The ecosystem strengthens.






5. Liquidity & Stability Reserve (LSR)

The LSR exists solely to support:

On-chain liquidity

Market stability

Gradual ecosystem growth


LSR rules:

Pre-minted and visible on-chain

Rate-limited deployment

Not used for rewards, salaries, or private sales

Fully auditable


LSR exists to stabilize the ecosystem — not to extract value.
