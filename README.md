 

DAUUZ (DUZ) : Decentralized Participation Token

Tagline: Elpis | Man paves his own path

DAUUZ is a prelaunch, fixed-supply digital token that rewards effort, contribution, and real-world participation, with a long-term vision of connecting personal growth and mental wellness to tangible value. Unlike most systems that reward capital or speculation, DAUUZ rewards meaningful action and human contribution   all before any blockchain integration.

1. Vision

DAUUZ is designed to empower ordinary people to earn digital wealth through awareness, contribution, and self-growth, instead of machines, algorithms, or speculation.

Connects personal development with token rewards

Builds community-first ecosystems

Creates scarce, psychologically meaningful digital assets

Prelaunch MVP simulates participation mining before chain launch


> “We reward presence, creativity, and consistency.”

2. Tokenomics (Prelaunch)

Total Supply: 20,000,000 DUZ (reserved at genesis)

Core Philosophy:

No inflation

Scarcity-driven

Participation-based rewards

Community-focused distribution


> Blockchain integration will come later; currently all rewards and balances are managed in-app and on our Supabase backend.

3. Prelaunch Participation Mining System

During the prelaunch MVP phase, users earn DUZ by performing verifiable actions:

Task	Reward	Limit

Referral	0.01 DUZ	Unlimited

Awareness / Social Post	0.0125 DUZ	Max 4 posts/day

Survey Completion	0.025 DUZ	Once per user

Innovative Idea Submission	1 DUZ	Reviewed by team

Exceptional Idea	10 DUZ	Extremely rare, selected by core team



Principle: Hard-earned DUZ = Real contribution, not wasted resources.

4. Zoi Integration (Future Phase)

Zoi is a mental wellness companion planned to integrate with DAUUZ:

Journaling & self-reflection

Emotional wellness exercises

Daily progress tracking


Conversion (Future): Zoi Points → DUZ via controlled cycles once blockchain launch occurs.

> You grow → You heal → You earn → The ecosystem strengthens.
