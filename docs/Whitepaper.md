# DAUUZ Whitepaper

## Overview
DAUUZ is a fixed-supply digital token (DUZ) designed to reward contribution, creativity, and participation : especially from people ignored by traditional systems. Its mission is to reward effort and presence rather than capital.

## Tokenomics
-  Total Supply:  20,000,000 DUZ (Fixed)  
-  Distribution:   
  - ⅓ Airdrop : free distribution to anyone willing to receive it  
  - ⅓ Early Contributors : community builders, first believers, and early contributors  
  - ⅓ Public sale : distributed through tasks, contributions, and future applications  
-  No VC allocation, no hidden minting. 

## Reward System (Planned)
-  Referral:  0.1 DUZ  
-  Awareness/Post:  0.125 DUZ (max 4/day)  
-  Survey:  0.25 DUZ (once per user)  
-  Innovative Idea:  10 DUZ (rare)  
-  Groundbreaking Idea:  100 DUZ (very rare)

## Core Philosophy
Most systems reward capital. DAUUZ rewards effort.  
Hope (Elpis) is dangerous : it compels action, which is the essence of DAUUZ.

## Roadmap
1.  Community Building  : recruit early believers, document structure, validate reward mechanics.  
2.  Mock Reward Simulation  : test productivity-based earning via `mock_rewards.js`.  
3.  Smart Contract Development  : implement ERC-20 DUZ token on Base or other L2.  
4.  Integration with Zoi  : mental-health-focused app, periodic minting of DUZ based on meaningful usage.  
5.  Official Launch  : full token distribution, community engagement, potential partnerships.

## Early Contribution Call
We are looking for developers, designers, and systems thinkers who value  long-term vision over quick money .  
*No promises, no salary : only honesty and a real attempt to build something meaningful.*
