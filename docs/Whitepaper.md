DAUUZ Whitepaper (v1.0)

DAUUZ (DUZ) — Decentralized Participation Token
Tagline: Elpis — Man paves his own path




1. Overview

DAUUZ is a fixed-supply digital token designed to reward real human contribution, creativity, and consistent action. Unlike most systems that reward capital, speculation, or attention, DAUUZ rewards presence, effort, and meaningful engagement — long before any blockchain deployment.

The project starts off-chain via a prelaunch MVP dashboard, simulating participation mining, and will gradually integrate on-chain and with Zoi, a mental wellness companion app.

> “We reward effort, not speculation.”






2. Vision

DAUUZ empowers people to earn value by taking action.
Its goals:

Connect personal growth, community participation, and digital wealth

Build a contribution-first ecosystem

Establish scarce, meaningful digital assets

Provide prelaunch, verifiable participation rewards before blockchain integration


DAUUZ is long-term, deliberate, and transparent.




3. Tokenomics

Total Supply: 30,000,000 DUZ (fixed)

Distribution:

Category	Amount	Notes

Community + Airdrop	2,000,000	Early users, free distribution, prelaunch MVP

Contributors & Earned Tasks	4,000,000	Reward for prelaunch contribution, tasks, referrals

Zoi Reserve (Locked)	10,000,000	Minted via Zoi Points cycles every 2–4 years

Liquidity & Stability Reserve (LSR)	14,000,000	On-chain liquidity, market stability, future expansion


Principles:

Hard cap, no hidden minting

No VC allocation or private shortcuts

Scarcity-driven, transparent, participation-based


> During the prelaunch MVP, all balances are tracked off-chain in a secure backend (Supabase).






4. Prelaunch Participation System (MVP)

Before blockchain deployment, DAUUZ runs a task-based participation system:

Task	Reward (DUZ)	Limit

Referral	0.001	Unlimited

Awareness / Social Post	0.00125	Max 4/day

Survey Completion	0.005	Once per user

Feedback 0.0014 Weekly 

Wellness Routine 0.014 Daily

Idea Submission	1	Reviewed by team



Principle: Only real effort generates DUZ. Bots, automation, and shortcuts are worthless.

All rewards are tracked transparently in the backend, with balances reflected in each user’s profile.




5. Zoi Integration (Future Phase)

Zoi is a planned mental wellness companion app:

Journaling and self-reflection

Emotional wellness exercises

Daily progress tracking


Zoi → DUZ Conversion:

Users earn Zoi Points

Points convert to DUZ through controlled mint cycles

Mint cycles occur every 2–4 years, similar to Bitcoin halvings

Draws from the 10M Zoi Reserve


> You grow → You heal → You earn → The ecosystem strengthens.






6. Liquidity & Stability Reserve (LSR)

The LSR ensures long-term market health:

14,000,000 DUZ reserved for liquidity, stability, and ecosystem growth

Fully auditable and transparent

Not used for salaries, early investors, or speculation


> The LSR protects participants and maintains ecosystem integrity.






7. Roadmap

Phase 1 — Prelaunch MVP (Current):

Dashboard, referral system, task tracking

Prelaunch DUZ earned by action


Phase 2 — Participation Expansion:

Social campaigns, contributor onboarding

Refined task rewards and leaderboard


Phase 3 — Blockchain Integration:

Testnet deployment of DUZ ERC-20 token

On-chain liquidity

Transparency and auditability


Phase 4 — Zoi Integration:

Mental wellness app launch

Zoi Point cycles convert to DUZ

Scalable, human-first token economy





8. Principles

Scarcity: Fixed supply from genesis

Transparency: Open, auditable distribution

Human-First: Rewards real effort, not capital

Integrity: No hype, no shortcuts

Community: Build in public, deliberate growth





9. Call for Early Contributors

DAUUZ is seeking:

Engineers (frontend, backend, smart contracts)

Designers & UX experts

Community managers & systems thinkers


> Early contributors are rewarded with DUZ in the prelaunch system.
This is not a get-rich-quick project — it’s long-term, meaningful, and deliberate.
